### Lessons Learned
- Casting, while I have used it before I was having trouble getting my interface to work and was able to use casting to fix it.
- Stepping away and coming back after a break does help. I like to work and work until I get frustrated and can't think. This was the first project that challenged me for more than a moment.
- If I stop and think I do understand how to fix the issues.
